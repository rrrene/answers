Oakland Answers is based on [Honolulu Answers](http://answers.honolulu.gov): a new approach to make it easier for people to navigate city information and services quickly. It's a citizen-focused website that is question-driven, with clean, easy-to-navigate design. Unlike a portal destination, Honolulu Answers is like Google -- type in anything, and it probably gives you the answer you're looking for, using the words you know. Every page on the site is an answer to a potential Google search question by a citizen, written in simple, friendly language, as if you'd asked your neighbor a question. The content is organized based on citizen understanding, the intuitive way you'd think of a problem, not the way the city is organized internally.

Honolulu Answers is designed to be very user-friendly. It declutters the govt website experience, and it solves a problem people ordinarily have. And we hope it makes people's lives easier. Inspired by Gov.uk, Honolulu Answers is a first-of-its-kind for municipal government, a partnership between Code for America and the City & County of Honolulu.

## First, a big Thank You:

## Installation

**If you are using OS X Snow Leopard, Lion or Mountain Lion, please follow this guide which will take you through the setup procedure**

Mac OS X is best supported by Honolulu Answers, since it is what most of us at Code for America use. Ubuntu (and therefore presumeably other linux distributions) are also supported.  Windows is currently unsupported and untested.  

[Installation Instructions for OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion](https://github.com/codeforamerica/honolulu_answers/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-OS-X-10.8-Mountain-Lion)

Slightly outdated Ubuntu instructions are available [here](https://github.com/codeforamerica/honolulu_answers/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Ubuntu-12.04-Precise).


## Usage
    
    $ foreman start

## Deploying to Heroku
    
    $ heroku create honoluluanswers --stack cedar
    $ git push heroku master

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before
submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
already been submitted. You can indicate support for an existing issue by
voting it up. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][] that
includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the
bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a
bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

[gist]: https://gist.github.com/

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Add tests for your feature or bug fix.
5. Run `bundle exec rake test`. If your changes are not 100% covered, go back
   to step 4.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Submit a pull request. Please do not include changes to the gemspec or
   version file. (If you want to create your own version for some reason,
   please do so in a separate commit.)

## Roadmap
* Support other search indexes backends/services (perhaps just fulltext search in DB as a fallback)
* A comprehensive admin component
* Results tailored to current location

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

 * Ruby 1.9.3

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
